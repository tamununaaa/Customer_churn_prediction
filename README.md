For this project, a Telecom Customer Churn dataset is used from ![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)
and we build a Deep Learning Model for churn prediction. 

The prediction model is built using Artificial Neural Network, and the following libraries and APIs:
